### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm a Web3 security researcher, here's a collection of some of my findings at [C4](https://code4rena.com/):

* [Project funds can be drained by reusing signatures](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/95)
* [Attacker can drain all the projects within minutes, if admin account has been exposed](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/264)
* [Project.raiseDispute() doesn't use approvedHashes - meaning users who use contracts can't raise disputes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-rigor-findings/issues/340)
* Uninitialized proxy - [Vault implementation can be destroyed leading to loss of all assets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional-findings/issues/200)
* [Fraction price is not updated when total supply changes
](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-fractional-findings/issues/337)
* [Try-catch block doesn't catch all errors](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-nouns-builder#m-12-try-catch-block-at-auction_createauction-will-only-catch-string-errors)
* Hash Collisoin - [risk of using only part of `keccak256()`'s output](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-09-party/#m-03-only-part-of-keccak256-is-used-as-hash-making-it-susceptible-to-collision-attacks)


 (I've included only a small sample, plus the recent contests aren't public yet, will update as they become public)
